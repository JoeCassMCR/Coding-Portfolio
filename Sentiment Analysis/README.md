# Sentiment Analysis 

This project classifies political tweet sentiment during the 2020 US Presidential election using traditional and transformer-based models. The pipeline evaluates:
- A custom neural network trained on TF-IDF features
- Pretrained DistilBERT and BERTweet transformer models
- Rule-based VADER sentiment scoring
